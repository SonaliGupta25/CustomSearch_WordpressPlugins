# CustomSearch_WordpressPlugins
This is a Wordpress plugin based website, equipped with Toolset, Elementor. 

This is a Real Estate Site created, the objective of designing this site was to become friendly with the Wordpress and without writing
lengthy detailed codes, beautiful sites can be created. 

Toolset  plugins for Wordpress allow us to create a custom search,
which intern allows the site viewers to easily and manageably find out the content from the site of their interest. 
Elementor is another important plugin that was also used and explored during the site designing. 
Here, I have majorly worked on the CSS, HTML code of the site, enabling custom searches. Exploring and playing with Loop Wizard, 
Field and views template as well as Content Template.

The items to be displayed upon searching some content on the Real Estate Website are also filtered and changed so that users can 
be a little more relatable in context with the price and location of the estate. This site will be a interative window for the 
'first time explorers' of Wordpress, understanding its working and coming up with some interactable and colorful product.
